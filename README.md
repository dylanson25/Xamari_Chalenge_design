## General considerations provaders of my instructor:

- Use the combination of any of the items seen in class and/or the ones I research 
- Replace in any case the images to your liking (except the size)
- In all cases use solid colors (not gradients)
- In all cases omit the shadow effect
- Do research if you need it.
- Upload your project to your personal drive and just share the read-only access link with me
- You can consult any written or audiovisual tutorial except asking another colleague
- Use a "Page" for each of the images in the layout

## Expected result of the design challenge
